Sometimes you want to work on a simple web page, and you don't want the burden
of having to setup some hosting environment.

Once again, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can help you. By
creating a repo and working in the `gh-pages` branch instead of `master`,
you will automatically get your site up and running.

Bonus point, you can set a `CNAME` to host it under your **own domain**.

Follow this gist, and do it all from the terminal!
